# FlexiPredict: AI-Driven Financial Intelligence Terminal

FlexiPredict is a high-fidelity financial dashboard designed for institutional-grade market analysis. It combines real-time price simulation with Google's Gemini 3 Pro AI to provide actionable trading insights for Gold, Silver, and major stocks.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-Time Market Engine**: Simulates live price fluctuations and volume changes every 5 seconds.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Utilizes the `gemini-3-pro-preview` model to analyze technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA) and provide "BUY/HOLD/SELL" calls.
- **Indian Market Focus**: All currency calculations and displays are localized to Indian Rupees (INR, ₹) using the Indian numbering system.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive Area Charts powered by Recharts with technical indicator overlays.
- **Deep Technical Analysis**: Calculates real-time RSI, MACD, 20-day & 50-day SMA, and Bollinger Bands.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 (ESM based)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **AI Integration**: `@google/genai` (Gemini API)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useMemo, useCallback for performance optimization)

## 🧠 AI Analysis Logic (`services/gemini.ts`)

The application sends a structured prompt to Gemini containing:
1. **Asset Metadata**: Name and Symbol.
2. **Current Pricing**: Live price and 24h percentage change.
3. **Technical Snapshot**: Current RSI value, MACD histogram, and SMA crossovers.
4. **Historical Context**: The last 5 price points to determine momentum.

Gemini returns a strictly typed JSON object based on a schema including a confidence score, a risk level, and 2-3 specific reasoning points.

## 📊 Data Simulation (`services/marketData.ts`)

Since this is a predictive terminal, the `marketData` service implements a "Random Walk" volatility algorithm:
- **Base Volatility**: 0.1% per update.
- **History Generation**: Pre-populates 50 hours of historical data upon initialization.
- **Indicator Calculation**: Mathematically derives RSI and SMA from the generated history arrays.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Watchlist**: Select an asset from the left sidebar to view its detailed dashboard.
2. **Analysis**: Upon selection, the AI automatically triggers a deep-dive analysis.
3. **Re-Analysis**: Use the **"Force Re-Analysis"** button in the header to get a fresh perspective if price action shifts significantly.
4. **Execution**: The "Execute Trade" button is a UI placeholder for integration with brokerage APIs.
